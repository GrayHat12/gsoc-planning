The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.\n\nThe installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR \"engine\") and some are very popular open source apps and services.",

The aim here is to avoid the situation today where game developers tolerate and work around driver bugs, due to the difficulty of identifying the root cause of a problem and isolating a stand-alone repro test.",

Finally, most of them are not available for most of the languages in the world, as they rely heavily on resources that are available for only a few languages.\n\nApertium uses a language-independent specification to allow for the ease of contributing to Apertium, more efficient development, and enhancing the project's overall growth.\n\nAt present, Apertium has released more than 40 stable language pairs, delivering fast translation with reasonably intelligible or excellent results depending on the language pair.  Being an open-source project, Apertium provides tools for potential developers to build their own language pair and contribute to the project.",

      "description": "# Overview\n\nappleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.\n\nappleseed is actively developed by a small, international team of talented volunteers from the animation and VFX industry. Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Paradigm\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Blender, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine\u2019s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by Fran\u00e7ois Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.",

      "description": "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on C++), and the Arduino Software (IDE or CLI tool).\n\nOver the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - tens of millions of students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.\n\nArduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.",

It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC for Golang, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, .NET (C#), Delphi and Rust.\n\nWhat Casbin does:\n\n1. Enforce the policy in the classic {subject, object, action} form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.\n2. Handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.\n3. Manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).\n4. Support built-in superuser like root or administrator. A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.\n5. Multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, keyMatch can map a resource key /foo/bar to the pattern /foo*.\n\nWhat Casbin does NOT do:\n\n1. Authentication (aka verify username and password when a user logs in)\n2. Manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.\n\nFor more details, see: https://casbin.org/",

      "description": "The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.  \n\nOur awarded Android app \u201cPocket Code\u201d is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That\u2019s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.  \n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.",

If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.\n\nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.\n\nIn addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: JokerTV integration, YouTube TV/Hulu support, AI, rclone, cloud, and a few more that are starting to take shape.\n\nThe best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics & technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.\n\nWe\u2019re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 7th time.

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world\u2019s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting\nChapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the\ncloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed.\nChapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration\nwith academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique\nexperience for students to work on projects involving high-performance\ncomputing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel\nprovides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a\nseparate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism\nfeatures make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and\nprogram.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task\nwhich uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in\nperformance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that\nplacement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to\ninitially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until\nthey are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design,\ntype inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or\nvice-versa) via interoperability features.",

      "description": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://rawgit.com/typetools/checker-framework/master/docs/developer/gsoc-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://rawgit.com/typetools/checker-framework/master/docs/developer/gsoc-ideas.html#get-started) and [how to ask questions](https://rawgit.com/typetools/checker-framework/master/docs/developer/gsoc-ideas.html#ask-questions).",

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn\u2019t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn\u2019t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.\n\nWe are building a platform called **EvalAI** as a scalable solution for the research community to fulfill the critical need for evaluating machine learning models. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, we seek to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain.\n\nThe platform is used by more than 20 organizations from industry and academia such as Facebook, eBay, IBM, Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech, etc. It has hosted 50+ AI challenges with 5500+ users who have created 51000+ submissions. It has more than 90+ open-source contributors and 1.3M+ page views since its launch in 2017. Several research organizations like Mapiallary research, IBM research, etc. are using its forked version for hosting their internal challenges instead of reinventing the wheel.",

It borrows many well known concepts from other Open Source projects: Kconfig, Linux kernel coding style, git repository, and Gerrit for code reviews.\n\ncoreboot has numerous advantages over other firmware projects. It comes with SoC support available to all developers. The codebase is shared with developers and companies which are helping improving the SoC and driver-specific implementations.\n\nExtremely fast\n\n* coreboot is designed to do the minimum amount necessary and get out of the way.\n* Desktop and Notebooks boot up in 400ms - 2.5s.\n* Server boot time can be as low as a quarter of the OEM BIOS boot time.\n\nFlexible and customizable\n\n* Because coreboot only does hardware init, then jumps to a payload to continue, it is very flexible.\n* GPLv2 licensed core. Payloads can be proprietary and we offer a BSD licensed support library. coreboot provides ready-to-build payloads like UEFI, SeaBIOS, U-Boot, Grub2 and many more..\n* Recovery Mode based on multiple copies of the firmware which can be updated independently.\n* Integrity of stages and binaries in coreboot can be easily verified.\n* Designed for security by default\n* Uses a minimal trusted computing base for each platform which is easily auditable, helping to guarantee security. As coreboot is Open Source, anyone can check the codebase.\n\nDebugging\n\n* There are multiple ways to extract the boot log, from classic serial to EHCI debug, even over the pc-speaker.\n* GDB Stub support via serial.\n* In memory console log support\n* Tracing functions and other exotic features are supported.",

Using this tool, you can freeze a running container or individual application and checkpoint it as a collection of files on disk. You can then use the files to restore the application and run it exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. With this feature, application live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are possible.\n\nCRIU started as a sub-project of OpenVZ and grew with tremendous help from the community. It is currently packaged for many Linux distributions and is integrated into such projects as OpenVZ, Virtuozzo, LXC/LXD, Docker runc, Podman, and other software. It's a part of a container live migration tool called p.haul that automates all the steps needed to live migrate a container with the smallest \"freeze time\" possible. For that it orchestrates the work of three core CRIU functionalities -- memory pre- and lazy- c/r, general save-restore and disk-less images transfer.\n\nAn essential part of the CRIU tool is the library called \"Compel\" which lets you inject so called parasite code into a running process. This library is the base of CRIU, but is independent from it and allows doing some marvellous tricks like re-directinng IO streams for processes, doing apps live-updates, manipulating the internal state of a running application in a way more powerful manner than gdb allows, etc.",

      "description": "The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million \"things\" of 685 different \"types\" in 125 languages, with over 3 billion \"facts\". It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications. For example, BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (such as SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That is the kind of query we are talking about.\nWe are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

      "description": "The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian.\n\nAn operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.\n\nDebian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel.\n\nHowever, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.\n\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\n\nOf course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 59000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\n\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian \u2014 carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.",

Transparency is a relatively easy concept to understand: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest. While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\r\n\r\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over [three hundred and sixty](https://projects.eclipse.org/) open source projects covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody. \r\n\r\nEclipse projects build technology in areas such as [Internet of Things](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things), [Programming Languages and IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language), and [Runtimes](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime) like Jetty and [EE4J](http://www.eclipse.org/ee4j) (currently known as Java EE) \r\n\r\nFor those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on [Science](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) where researches from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.\r\n\r\nYou've probably heard about our market-leading software development tools; we have that, and so much more...",

      "description": "[FrameNet Brasil](http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/) (FN-Br) is a Computational Linguistics lab of the Graduate Programs in Linguistics and Computer Sciences at the [Federal University of Juiz de Fora](https://www2.ufjf.br/international/), Brazil. It is also the Brazilian branch of the [FrameNet](https://globalframenet.org) initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.\n\n# The Database #\n\nFN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes [data](http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/) about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.\n\n# The Applications #\n\nFN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based multimodal [web annotation tool](https://github.com/FrameNetBrasil/webtool), a domain-specific dictionary - the [FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary](http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/world-cup-dictionary/); a system for recommending tourist attractions - [m.knob](http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/m-knob/); a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA.",

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realizing it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began 26 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.",

The game engine is general purpose and powerful enough for any 2D game. \nGDevelop was used for hundreds of indie games on **Android, iOS**, desktop (**Windows/macOS/Linux**) or the **web** (HTML5 games).\n\n# Events: making game creation intuitive for all\n\nWhat makes GDevelop unique and so easy to use are the **events**. Events are a powerful way to express the logic of your game, without having to learn a programming language. In an event, you specify one or more conditions that are applied on the game objects. If they are fulfilled, actions are launched.\nThese events are then translated to code when the game is exported or previewed.\n\nGDevelop takes visual programming to the next step, allowing to add *ready-made behaviors* to game objects and to *make new behaviors* using these intuitive, easy to learn events.\n\n# An extensible and robust game engine\n\nGDevelop has out of the box support for [physics, shaders, particles, rich text, tweens, pathfinding, a platformer engine](https://gdevelop-app.com/features/)... and is bundled with 80+ examples.\n\nExtensions can be developed to enhance the game engine - all built-in features are provided by extensions. Users and developers can make extensions using **JavaScript** or using the **visual \nevents**.\n\nThe game engine and the editors are based on **WebGL** and **JavaScript** (Pixi.js, React.js for the editor interface) and **WebAssembly** (some parts are implemented in C++). It's easy to [start developing on the editor or extensions](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README.md) in a few minutes!\n\n# Documentation and wiki\n\nGDevelop is fully documented, with **help pages** and **tutorials** on [the wiki](http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/start) (including one written during Google Season of Docs!).",

      "description": "Every user has work they need to do. The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

      "description": "GeomScale is a research and development project that delivers open source code for state-of-the-art algorithms at the intersection of data science, optimization, geometric, and statistical computing. The current focus of GeomScale is scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and (limited) Python interfaces, for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. \n\nIn particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute intractable multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in computational economics as, by exploiting approximate volume computation of convex bodies, we use it to detect financial crises and evaluate portfolios performance in large stock markets with hundreds of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration, and data-driven power systems in control.",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.\n\nOctave is continually being upgraded. The current version 5.1 includes a graphical user interface, support for classdef object-oriented programming, and many new and improved functions. Student projects may also involve developing or upgrading Octave Forge packages, which can be loaded to provide additional specialized functions that supplement those provided in Core Octave.",

It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nGNU Radio is implemented using C++ and Python. The run-time and signal progressing uses C++ and VOLK, a low-level math library for SIMD operations that grew out the project. GNU Radio applications are build using Python which make it really easy to configure and connect blocks into flow-graphs. On top of that, we have a graphical flow-graph editor that generates Python or C++ application code including graphical widgets (Qt) to control and visualize the application status.\n\nThe GNU Radio ecosystem is comprised of the core project and a great number of external packages and tools. These extend the capabilities of GNU Radio by providing additional signal processing algorithms, support for RF hardware and/or entire applications build on-top of them.",

It should not be overly detailed just enough to understand the problem trying to be fixed and how this project opt to solve it.\n* How will I achieve this: Explain how the project will be done, what technologies are needed and how to implement them.\n* What will the project focus on: Explain what the project will focus on, what is the important parts of the project.\n* Benefits: Who will benefit and why from this project. Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.\n* Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.\n* What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.\n* Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge what hardware etc.",

It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n\n# What is Lua?\n\nLua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n# What is C\u00c3\u00a9u?\n\nC\u00c3\u00a9u provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. C\u00c3\u00a9u can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.",

An open-source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station accessible on the web for all of the network users. A basic ground station up can be set-up using commercial off-the-shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing, 210+ stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and 100+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.\n\nLibre Space, together with the University of Patras, are the makers of UPSat, the 1st free software, open-hardware cubesat. Currently, we are developing an open-hardware satellite communication subsystem for CubeSats designed to work seamlessly with the SatNOGS Network. In parallel, we are exploring the smaller PocketQube form factor in our Qubik mission of two PocketQube satellites and a PockeQube deployer system PicoBus. \n\nLibre Space Foundation is also implementing two European Space Agency activities.

      "description": "LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft\u00c2\u00ae Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

Please subscribe to the LibreOffice developer list and write an email to the list.\n\nWe will require students to complete one of the easy programming tasks on the \"Easy Hacks\" page (or part of one if that EasyHack is a selection of separate tasks), though the dead-line for this isn't hard but needs to be somewhere before the end of the selection process. This means that each student who wants to have chances to be picked for a LibreOffice project will need to build the whole application, fix a bug and submit the patch to the development mailing list.\n\nExplain what you want to achieve. Provide detailed informations on the project you want to work on and the use cases. The more precise your description is, the more it will show us that you investigated the area and though about it properly before submitting. The best is to base your project on one of our Ideas that come complete with friendly mentors to help you. You may have some nice project ideas, but make sure that someone will be able to mentor your project and knows that part of the code well enough.\n\nProblems that can not be resolved on our public developer mailing list or problems containing privacy relevant topics can also be sent to our mentoring@documentfoundation.org address.",

Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\n\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open source software both improving its administration and enabling open source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.",

      "description": "[MDAnalysis](https://mdanalysis.org) is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is widely used in the scientific community and is written by scientists for scientists.\n\nThe goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) (MD) simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data \u2014 agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it \u2014 that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for [new computational tools](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/).\n\nMDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by  MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the [protein databank](http://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB) format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks. \n\nMDAnalysis is a project written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, softmatter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it. Welcoming documentation such as the new [User Guide](https://www.mdanalysis.org/UserGuide/) make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited almost a thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.",

If you cannot  get the community to support your idea your chances for getting your proposal accepted are very slim. Finally, in order to have your GSoC application be accepted by MetaBrainz you MUST interact with your potential mentor and submit one bug fix or new feature that is related to your proposal. You will need to create a schedule of how you plan to spend your time. A weekly breakdown with a few milestones is best.\n\n* Do you have Github , Twitter or any other public profiles you think we might find interesting?\n* Have you contributed to other Open Source projects or created projects on your own time?

It can often significantly speed up Python code. We originally built mypyc to compile mypy, making mypy 4x faster. We are now looking at making mypyc useful for end users as a practical tool to make Python programs and libraries more efficient. \n\nIt's easy to ensure that programs compiled with mypyc continue to also be valid (non-compiled) Python programs. Modules compiled with mypyc can freely interact with interpreted modules. Mypyc lets you compile a few performance-sensitive modules and keep the rest of your program interpreted.",

      "description": "The [National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)](https://www.nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery. Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/), [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/), [SBML](https://sbml.org/), and [cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.org/). *This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!* For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over **18,000 times per month** by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our [>90% success rate](http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students [students](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and [mentors](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab). Find out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB. Also refer to the [NRNB GSoC page](http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html) for additional resources and application tips.",

      "description": "For blind people to use a computer, they need a screen reader which reads the text on the screen using a synthetic voice or a braille display. However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news. \n\nIn April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader. NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards. NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.\n\nMajor highlights include: \n* Support for popular applications including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel \n* A built-in speech synthesizer supporting over 50 languages, plus support for many other 3rd party voices \n* Reporting of textual formatting where available such as font name and size, style and spelling errors \n* Support for many refreshable braille displays, including input of Braille via braille displays that have a braille keyboard \n* Ability to run entirely from a USB flash drive or other portable media without the need for installation \n* Easy to use talking installer \n* Support for modern Windows Operating Systems including both 32 and 64 bit variants \n* Ability to run at Windows logon and other secure screens",

      "description": "**Introduction**\n\nThe Roberta Initiative \u201cLearning with Robots\u201d was started more than 18 years ago by Fraunhofer IAIS in Germany with the objective to get kids interested in technology and science by constructing and programming robotic kits. The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.\n\n**The Lab**\n\nThe Open Roberta\u00ae Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to program robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO\u00ae. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 https://lab.open-roberta.org/ is online and has had more than 500 000 visits in 2019 across more than 120 countries.\n\nThe backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 12 different robot plugins:\n\n- EV3 LEGO Mindstorms\n- NXT LEGO Mindstorms\n- BBC micro:bit\n- Calliope mini\n- Bot\u2019n Roll, Arduino-based\n- NAO, a humanoid robot\n- BOB3\n- Nepo4Arduino\n- mBot\n- SenseBox\n- WeDo LEGO\n- Edison\n\n**Outlook**\n\nWhile the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.",

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy is currently formed by [16 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

      "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide that raises all ships. \n\nOver the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

Its design has influenced many other tools, not counting forks and rebranded versions.\n\n## Scope of the tool\n\nThe tool is used to perform data transformations on small to medium-scale datasets, by interactively building workflows which mix automated transforms and human review. The transformations are reproducible: they can be replayed on datasets in the same format, with updated data. The focus is on usability through a web UI, reducing the need to learn a programming or query language.\n\n##\u00a0Stack\n\nOpenRefine is built in Java (server-side) and uses a web UI (jQuery). It is easy to work on isolated parts of the code without being familiar with the entire architecture. We try to maintain good quality standards, by testing all our changes, but remain flexible and un-opiniated.",

If you want to follow a template, this one is a good starting point:\n\nIntroduction: Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What\u2019s the current state? What\u2019s the issue you wish to solve and why? This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\nProject goals: This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\nImplementation: This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\nTimeline: With the timeline, you show your understanding of the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains.\n\nAbout me: Write a few lines about you.\n\nIdeas page: https://101.opensuse.org/",

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/homepage/elenco-siti-tematici/wifimetropolitano/)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\n\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/it/progetti/openwisp) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.\n\nThe software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 [network management system](http://openwisp.org) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.",

      "description": "# Why Oppia?\nOppia\u2019s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

      "description": "Orcasound is an open source project that makes it easy to listen live for animals that make sounds, like the endangered orcas in Washington State (aka Southern Resident Killer Whales, or SRKWs). We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.  \n\nSince a Kickstarter in mid-2017, [key members of our community](http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/) have built a [web app](http://live.orcasound.net) that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7. Version 2 of the app, now in beta-testing, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The [web-app repository](https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite) has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. While users enjoy the live \u201cconcert\u201d they are offered a timely call to action -- often aimed at reducing the underwater noise pollution near Seattle which impedes the orcas\u2019 ability to communicate & echolocate scarce salmon.\n\nOrcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery: \n* [orcanode](https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode) holds Python code and shell scripts that generate the live audio stream in lossy HLS or DASH format to optimize audio playback within modern browsers and lossless FLAC format for scientific analysis. \n* [orcadata](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata) houses  multiple team efforts to develop machine learning algorithms and data processing tools for bioacoustics and underwater noise pollution.  \n* [orcabooth](https://github.com/orcasound/orcabooth) shares Orcasound recordings with educational/outreach organizations. \n* [orcamap](https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap) visualizes acoustic detection and classification data spatially.",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.\n\n# How does PEcAn do that? #\n\nPEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.",

These services are distributed and scale to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.\n\nPCP supports many different platforms, including Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows. From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n1. PCP Collectors\n\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n2. PCP Monitors\n\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed. Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the pcp-gui or grafana-pcp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely. On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain. All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients. Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

      "description": "# Pitivi is a truly unique video editor.\n\nWith its \"no downstream hacks\" and \"upstream first\" approach, it acts as a cutting-edge catalyst to push open-source technologies we love forward.\n\nIt champions design and usability research: there is no eternal newbie, and Pitivi's user interface is carefully designed to suit both the newcomer and the professional, to be efficient and intuitive. We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.\n\nIt is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by longstanding contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.\n\n## Ecosystem\n\nPitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.\n\nThe pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.\n\nIn addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.\n\n## Tooling\n\nThe many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.",

The Foundation\u2019s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields \u2014 and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

      "application_instructions": "Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation! We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries/add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on GitHub](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant GitHub repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/). \n\nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but we also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nWvtq-CXy8uc3BE3RwVX9vH4ug2uNQsUkqm-VsHTrC8/edit?usp=sharing).",

It has a special emphasis on generating audio and/or video in real time, with low latency.  Much of its design focuses on receiving, manipulating, and delivering high-quality audio signals. Specifically, the software addresses the problem of how to do this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like OSX, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.\n\nPurr Data can easily work over local and remote networks.  It can be used to integrate wearable technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. It is also suitable for learning basic multimedia processing and visual programming methods, as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale projects.",

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute\n - You can also choose a \u201cbackup\u201d idea (the second task you probably want to do) so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis.\n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function\u2014an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2020, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).",

With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.",

Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to \u201cmix\u201d elements from different sets for calculations.

      "description": "Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 35 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.",

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\n HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  \nThis library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the \nBoost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and \nvery portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including \nLinux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as \naccelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\n We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications \nwhich makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and \ndistributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently \nHPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the \nfuture we hope to expand its influence to include common applications \nthat touch our everyday lives.\n\n If you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC \nresearch, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check \nout our [ideas page](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-%28GSoC%29-2020) \nand contact us either through the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) \nor via an email at <hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu>",

      "description": "[SymbiFlow](http://symbiflow.github.io/) is a group of projects aimed at providing a completely FOSS flow for developing FPGA IP/gateware. We believe this will dramatically broaden the outreach of FPGA platforms and lower entry barriers into FPGA development for both professional engineers and hobbyists.\n\nFPGAs are an exciting and versatile development platform that can be used for addressing a variety of complex tasks, such as:\n\n* flexible parallel I/O\n* low-latency machine learning\n* robotics and motor control\n* camera interfacing and ISP\n* hardware glue logic\n* general hardware-accelerated parallel processing\n\nA big roadblock to what we believe should be much wider adoption are the specific tools that need to be learned on a per-vendor basis and their proprietary licensing.\n\nBy working to implement a **vendor neutral** and **modular** flow that is **easy to integrate** with various types of other tools, and that provides an open source, transparent development experience, SymbiFlow is meant to dramatically accelerate software-driven innovation in FPGA development.\n\nSymbiFlow is already enabling new tools, development platforms and communities that build around the end-to-end open flow - and has made significant progress throughout 2019. But a lot of work is still needed before it becomes a standard like GCC in the software world.\n\nTo achieve SymbiFlow's goal of a complete end-to-end FOSS FPGA toolchain, a number of tools and projects are necessary. Thus, SymbiFlow serves as an umbrella project for several activities, the central of which deals with creating so-called [FPGA \"architecture definitions\"](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs), i.e. documentation of how specific FPGAs work internally.\n\nThose definitions serve as input to open source backend tools like nextpnr and Verilog to Routing, and frontend tools like Yosys. They are created within separate collaborating projects targeting different FPGAs - [Project X-Ray](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjxray) for Xilinx 7-Series, [Project IceStorm](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm) for Lattice iCE40 and [Project Trellis](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis) for Lattice ECP5 FPGAs.",

Think your application through and take time to write it, as its quality is what matters first and foremost.\n4. Remember to discuss your proposal with us on IRC/slack to get our feedback, that will most probably resolve most if not all uncertainty.\n5. Read the existing documentation.

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.\n\nThe main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.\n\nWith Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.\n\nMain features\n===========\n\n**- Vector tweening**\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.\n\n**- Layers and Filters**\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.\n\n**- Bones**\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.\n\n**- Linking elements**\nYou can link parameters of various layers \u2013 directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.\n\nExamples of works created with Synfig\n==============================\n\n* [Morevna Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k)\n* [Polar Detective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc)\n* [Synfig Promo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w)\n* [Demo Reel by VanChatto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA)\n* [The Deadline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8)\n* [Pluto takes life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs)",

      "description": "# Why syslog-ng?\n\nWith syslog-ng, you can collect logs from wide range of sources, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.\n\nsyslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, and correlate logs from across your infrastructure (even from routers, embedded systems) and store or route them to log analysis tools.\n\nBy integrating with big data tools it is possible to deliver log messages to kafka and elasticsearch, even store logs in hdfs.\n\n**Support for common inputs**\n\nsyslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.\n\n**Flexible data extraction**\n\nWorking with unstructured data? That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.\n\n**Simplify complex log data**\n\nEven if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.\n\n**Databases destinations**\n\nIf you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.\n\n**Message queue support**\n\nsyslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.\n\n**HTTP/REST support**\n\nsyslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively\n\n**Support language bindings**\n\nWant to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",

Describe why the project will be useful for syslog-ng and/or the community. Also, describe why the project is interesting for you (because we are also interested in your motivation). If you can, provide us with some use cases in addition.\n 3. Define the goal of the project. Also, write a Definition of Done: when you consider the project ready and successful. If you have stretch goals (even if they probably will not get done, but can be a part of a further development), describe them too.\n 4. What knowledge areas are required for the success of the project? Which areas are you familiar with and which areas you have to improve?\n 5. Define a time schedule. Define milestones with dates (for example in weekly resolution) - with that you can easily split your project into smaller tasks, and it also facilitates following the progress and whether you are on track or not.\n\n\n*Please see our Student Guidelines for more details: https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/wiki/GSoC2020-Student-Guideline *",

Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).",

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2020 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Humboldt University - Germany, and Charles University - Czech Republic.\n\nJPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.",

It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, program analysis, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.\n\nYou can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2020-Project-Ideas) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it. You can either email it to us or share your idea on our mailing list. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding JPF and the GSoC program do not hesitate to email us.\n\nIn order to apply to our organization, you need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/16 - 03/31). Check out the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) page for more information.",

      "description": "Julia is a programming language for ease of use and performance, which is rapidly gaining momentum in all kinds of technical and scientific computing. Our community of users (including many past GSoC students!) has built state of the art packages for differential equations, machine learning, differentiable programming, mathematical optimization, physical modeling, and probabilistic programming. A Summer of Code project in Julia is an opportunity to work at the bleeding edge of any of these exciting fields.\n\nWork on the core language is welcome, but we are also acting as an umbrella organization for several packages in the Julia ecosystem. The major ones are:\n\n- [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/), for machine learning;\n- [CuArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CuArrays.jl) and the GPU programming stack;\n- [DifferentialEquations.jl](docs.juliadiffeq.org), for solving differential equations;\n- [Turing.jl](http://turing.ml/) for probabilistic programming.\n\n\nAs well as contributions to packages, we welcome self-contained projects that use these tools to do something interesting. For example, previous students have written speech recognition and reinforcement learning (e.g. AlphaGo) models for Flux\u2019s model zoo, or been involved in our Neural ODEs work.",

The Slack channel `#jsoc` is\ndedicated to helping students get the help they need. Additionally, you should\nmake use of these connections to start making some small contributions and\nprogress on your project early on. While PRs before the applications are not\nrequired, the Julia Language organization programs are extremely competitive,\nso the more ways you have to show your engagement, the better.\n\n# Application Guidelines\n\nApplications are free-form, so you can discuss your project in whatever way you\nfeel is best. Our organization does not have page or formatting requirements, but we recommend\nbuilding a formal PDF document of fewer than 10 pages which is formatted using\nWord or LaTeX. If you have any questions, contact the Julia Language student\nprogram administrators at jsoc@julialang.org. Please feel\nfree to share your draft applications in the `#jsoc` channel on Slack to\nreceive feedback.\n\nThe key questions we will ask ourselves when considering it are:\n\n* Is the student committed to the project?\n* Is the plan a reasonable amount to do in three months?\n* Are there clear milestones we can use to assess progress (it should be easy\n  to answer the question \"Is the project done?\").\n\n[See the application guideline page for more info on this process](https://julialang.org/jsoc/guidelines/).",

LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n * The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n * The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n * The MLIR subproject aims to address software fragmentation, compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific compilers, and aid in connecting existing compilers.\n * The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n * In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.",

[ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.30 in September 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 9000 members as of January 2020, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 250 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.",

      "description": "## The Organization\n\nThe Terasology Foundation is the organization behind Terasology, DestinationSol, and a series of related work aimed at making game development in Java easier and more fun. We've been working for years on educational awareness, challenging architecture, powerful developer workspaces, fun content, and much more\n\nOur contributors are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians of all ages. We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers\n\n## Our Games\n\n_Terasology_ is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world\n\nFrom the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.\n\n_Destination Sol_ is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.\n\n## Architecture\n\nOur engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.\n\nContent is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.\n\nThe game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!\n\n## Codeuino\n\nFor GSOC 2020 we're supporting http://codeuino.org to let them offer project ideas through us.",

      "description": "## Overview\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\n\n## What makes webpack unique?\n**Extensibility** webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\n\n**Focused** around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\n**Built in JavaScript** webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\n\n**Used at Scale** webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\n**Community Owned** webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling",

Feel free to contact the mentors or contact persons directly if you have any questions. Some FOSS projects may be open to our own suggestions and ideas about a potential GSoC project. Simply discuss those with the related projects.\n\nWe very much like to see that you get engaged with the projects your apply to as early as possible. For that, every project has a list of small (and ideally simple) teaser tasks you can start to work on right now. Please check with the project first if somebody else may already be working on the particular teaser task you have chosen. Note that while the tasks may be small, there is still some amount of effort required to work on them, like getting familiar with the project, its codebase and, for example, its build system. Do not underestimate that! Start as early as possible.",

      "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other team chat tools designed to help teams (whether [open source projects](https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source/) or companies) collaborate effectively via its unique [threading model](https://zulipchat.com/why-zulip/). Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open source and has a welcoming community of over 500 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (150,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot about how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",
